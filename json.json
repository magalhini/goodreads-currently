We are led to believe that if we could only look perfect and lead perfect lives, we'd no longer feel inadequate. So most of us perform, please, and perfect, all the while thinking, <i>What if I can't keep all of these balls in the air? Why isn't everyone else working harder and living up to my expectations? What will people think if I fail or give up? When can I stop proving myself?</i><br /><br />In <i>The Gifts of Imperfection</i>, Brené Brown, PhD, a leading expert on shame, authenticity and belonging, shares what she's learned from a decade of research on the power of <i>Wholehearted Living</i>--a way of engaging with the world from a place of worthiness.<br /><br />In her ten guideposts, Brown engages our minds, hearts, and spirits as she explores how we can cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, <i>No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough,</i> and to go to bed at night thinking, <i>Yes, I am sometimes afraid, but I am also brave. And, yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable, but that doesn't change the truth that I am worthy of love and belonging.</i>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["162578"],"name":["Brené Brown"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1246473726p5/162578.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1246473726p2/162578.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/162578.Bren_Brown"],"average_rating":["4.21"],"ratings_count":["130562"],"text_reviews_count":["10702"]}]}],"published":["2010"]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"currently-reading","exclusive":"true","review_shelf_id":"1560794091","sortable":"false"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Sun Feb 05 13:52:47 -0800 2017"],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Feb 05 13:52:46 -0800 2017"],"date_updated":["Sun Feb 05 13:52:47 -0800 2017"],"read_count":[""],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1903903801"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1903903801"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1800750244"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"26530319","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0393244792"],"isbn13":["9780393244793"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"45","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Book: A Cover-to-Cover Exploration of the Most Powerful Object of Our Time"],"title_without_series":["The Book: A Cover-to-Cover Exploration of the Most Powerful Object of Our Time"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1444265596m/26530319.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1444265596s/26530319.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26530319-the-book"],"num_pages":["428"],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.06"],"ratings_count":["197"],"description":["<b>“Everybody who has ever read a book will benefit from the way Keith Houston explores the most powerful object of our time. And everybody who has read it will agree that reports of the book’s death have been greatly exaggerated.”―Erik Spiekermann, typographer</b><br /><br />We may love books, but do we know what lies behind them? In The Book, Keith Houston reveals that the paper, ink, thread, glue, and board from which a book is made tell as rich a story as the words on its pages―of civilizations, empires, human ingenuity, and madness. In an invitingly tactile history of this 2,000-year-old medium, Houston follows the development of writing, printing, the art of illustrations, and binding to show how we have moved from cuneiform tablets and papyrus scrolls to the hardcovers and paperbacks of today. Sure to delight book lovers of all stripes with its lush, full-color illustrations, The Book gives us the momentous and surprising history behind humanity’s most important―and universal―information technology.<br /><br />71 color illustrations"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["6985221"],"name":["Keith Houston"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1376997859p5/6985221.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1376997859p2/6985221.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6985221.Keith_Houston"],"average_rating":["3.96"],"ratings_count":["1000"],"text_reviews_count":["223"]}]}],"published":[""]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"currently-reading","exclusive":"true","review_shelf_id":"1463728926","sortable":"false"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Wed Nov 02 00:11:23 -0700 2016"],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Wed Nov 02 00:11:22 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Wed Nov 02 00:11:23 -0700 2016"],"read_count":[""],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1800750244"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1800750244"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1566785068"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"6801335","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["014118938X"],"isbn13":["9780141189383"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"602","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Alone in Berlin"],"title_without_series":["Alone in Berlin"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403509628m/6801335.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403509628s/6801335.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6801335-alone-in-berlin"],"num_pages":["602"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Penguin Classics"],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":["2009"],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.21"],"ratings_count":["14326"],"description":[""],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["227026"],"name":["Hans Fallada"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1235497177p5/227026.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1235497177p2/227026.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/227026.Hans_Fallada"],"average_rating":["4.15"],"ratings_count":["19254"],"text_reviews_count":["2462"]}]}],"published":["2009"]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"currently-reading","exclusive":"true","review_shelf_id":"1528834860","sortable":"false"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Sat Jan 07 14:28:10 -0800 2017"],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Wed Mar 02 08:55:40 -0800 2016"],"date_updated":["Sat Jan 07 14:28:10 -0800 2017"],"read_count":[""],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1566785068"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1566785068"],"owned":["0"]}]
